# Bangkit 2022 Capstone Project ( C241-PS393 ) : Machine Learning Model (Skin Type Detection)

Maintaining healthy facial skin is a significant concern for many people. Identifying one's skin type accurately can help in choosing the right skincare routine and products. This project aims to develop a machine learning application that can detect skin types based on facial images.

## Objectives

1. Develop a machine learning model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow.js to classify facial skin types.
2. Ensure data quality by cleaning noisy images and augmenting the dataset.
3. Create an integrated system that provides users with articles containing skin care advice tailored to their skin type.

## How To Run Our Project (Google Collaboratory)

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open Google Colab.
   - In a new notebook, run the following code to clone the repository:
     ```python
     !git clone https://github.com/PrettyU-Skin-Health-Solutions/Machine-Learning.git
     ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change directory to the cloned repository:
     ```python
     %cd Machine-Learning
     ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed by running:
     ```python
     !pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Load the Dataset:**
   - The dataset is already included in the repository, so no need to upload anything manually.

5. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open the project notebook and run each cell step by step, following the instructions provided in the notebook.

6. **Enjoy and See the Results!** :D
